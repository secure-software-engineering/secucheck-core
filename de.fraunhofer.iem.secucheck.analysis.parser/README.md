# parser
This project implements the parser for checking whether a given FluentTQL flow
participant is equal to an analyzed code statement. This functionality is used 
inside the [implementation](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/secucheck-core/tree/masterarbeit/MA0208/de.fraunhofer.iem.secucheck.analysis.implementation)
module. To use this module somewhere else, one has
to include it as dependency in the respective Maven project or module.
